        <h1>Flank Steak</h1>
        <h2><em>From "Cow" to "Wow"</em></h2>
        <p>When it comes to a dinner centerpiece that combines health and satisfaction, steak is a tough entree to beat. I opted to include my Flank Steak preparation as this cut contains a particularly admirable beef taste. <a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/695592/steak-guide-cuts-types/">Check out the world of steak cuts here.</a></p>
       <h3>Preparation</h3>
       <dl>
        <dt>1. Gather your Seaoning and Let Steak Sit</dt>
            <dd>Remove steak from the fridge and let it sit out so it can approach room temperature. While this happens, we should pull out the seasonings. I like to include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Pepper</li>
                    <li>Citrus Garlic Seasoning along with 5-6 garlic cloves</li>
                    <li>Montreal Steak Seasoning &#40From Costco. Any Canadian city will be sufficient.&#41</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
        <dt>2. The Cooking</dt>
            <dd>It is time. Place an oven safe pan on the stovetop and heat to the hightest possible heat along with 2tbsp of Olive Oil minimum &#40while the pan heats, preheat oven to 400&#41. Once the heating is done, allow steak to sear on both sides for 2-3 mins. After this put the garlic cloves on the pan along with butter on one side of the steak and put this in the oven for 3:30 seconds. After this, remove from the oven, flip the steak, and add butter to the new side. Cook for another 3:30 seconds and depending on your steak width you will get the ultimate medium rare. </dd>
   

        <h3>You're Done!</h3>
